* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    Sun and Zhang graduated from the Y combinator program, a startup accelerator, back in 2012. After graduation, Sun and Zhang started Debteye in 2012 and the idea came about when Sun applied for a professional loan at a traditional brick and mortar establishment. He found the application process to be time consuming and frustrating. 

    They then set out to build their business Debteye which was a platform designed to help individuals make informed decisions based on their unique financial situation. This along with their Y combinator venture became the inspiration for what became Avant. 

    Towards the end of 2012, they partnered with Al Goldstein, a chicago entrepreneur at Enova. As former interns of Goldstein’s at Enova, they saw an opportunity to generate funding with him to build a product that made borrowing a more streamlined process.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    Since inception of P2P platforms in 2005, the peer-to-peer lending interest rates are significantly lower compared to credit card interest rates. Additionally, the delinquency rates are lower compared to traditional consumer loans. From 2010 to 2014, the national average of P2P loans that were past due was 3.2% compared to traditional loans of 3.7%.

    In terms of innovation, more borrowers are going directly online as machine learning technology has become more and more reliable with reducing risk and fraud. Another groundbreaking innovative measure from this domain is that lenders can invest as little as $25 to get started.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    I would suggest offering a live chat button on their website similar to what OnDeck has which is their primary competitor. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    Giving even immediate accessibility to customer’s questions and potentially increasing loan applications right there and then. This is opposed to a customer submitting a question via email and waiting for an answer which may take several hours to a day. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    Instant messaging technology 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    By implementing an instant messaging option on their website, the goal is to increase sales conversion by reducing the amount of time customers may need in answering their questions. By doing so, customers may feel more comfortable and ready to apply for a loan the first time they visit the site as opposed to waiting for responses and researching other options.
